# Currencies

The money folder stores all currencies, rubles, euros, dollars, in which the exchange rate is stored in dollars, for example, 0.8 euros = 1 dollar.
In the adapters folder, we call the RubAdapter class method from the valueDollarI interface. And so on for all adapters.
In the TestAdapter classes, I show the work of all adapters.
